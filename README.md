# Using an agent-based model to analyze usage of the Mosquito deterrence device in public parks
A paper I wrote during my mathematical modelling class in undergrad on using an agent-based model to observe the effects of a sound-based deterrence device called a "Mosquito". The model was created in Java (with some analysis afterwards done with Python), and the figures were created with draw.io (now diagrams.net) and matplotlib.

The abstract from the paper: "Presbycusis is a condition that results in a loss of the ability to hear higher frequencies with age. The Mosquito is a sound deterrence device that uses high-frequency sounds to target youths from loitering in public parks.  In this paper we create an agent-based model to analyze the effectiveness of the device and to see whether the effects are relevant. We ultimately find that the Mosquito has a slight effect on the mean age of the park but no effect on the mode age, giving the impression that the device has little effect on the overall age distribution of the park's population. Thus, it appears that the Mosquito could potentially discriminate against youth. We conclude by suggesting further improvements for the model."
